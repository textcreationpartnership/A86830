            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They are not ignorant, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication doth proceed as is afore-≈øaid; if not in the name, yet in the Authority and Juri≈ødiction of the Bi≈øhop, or ≈øome other chiefe Clergy-man, to whom the power of the Keyes doth belong, and unto whom the Church of England hath a≈ø≈øigned the execution of that part of our Di≈øcipline. Who, if they u≈øe the advi≈øe and Mini≈øtery of a wi≈øe and religious Civilian, in decreeing who is to be excommunicate, (whereupon tho≈øe<note n="f" place="margin">Perpetuall govern, of the Chu. pa. 320.</note> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward penalties doe en≈øue, which attend the authority, and follow the ≈øentence of Excommunication, in this Church &amp; Common wealth:) how doth that in any wi≈øe violate Chri≈øts in≈øtitution as touching exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>munication?</p>

But in the mean time, what motions are the≈øe for the reformers to make unto a mo≈øt prudent Prince in his ≈øettled and peaceable government; who for many years, hath had triall in that his other kingdome, of their pretended reformation; and in this al≈øo hath ≈øeen the gracious effects under her Maje≈øties late hapy Raign of that Church Di≈øcipline, which they would ruinate and overthrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God hath appointed his Maje≈øty unto this Kingdome.</hi> It is true; and we magnifie the goodne≈ø≈øe of God for it, and congratulate his Highnes in the pro≈øperous po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, from the ground of our hearts. But that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to this kingdome <hi>for ≈øuch a purpo≈øe as they conceite;</hi> what ≈øpirit of divination is in them, that they ≈øhould fore≈øpeake it? Nay rather, ≈øeeing almighty God hath ordained him as the great Phy≈øitian (next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under him≈øelfe,) to take care of the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:157032:15"/>both of his Church and Common-wealth; he will ≈øurely cure ≈øuch di≈øea≈øes, as the≈øe men are ≈øick of. (For turbulent and di≈øcontented humors are like to breed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous de≈øea≈øes in a civill State:) And not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded (as they fondly imagine) by ≈øuch ≈øugge≈øtions as the≈øe, to alter that ≈øtate of the Church, which is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, honorable to his Highnes, comfortable to many thou≈øand Mini≈øters, the Nur≈øe of good learning, admirable to ≈øtrangers, approved by our<note n="*" place="margin">The letters that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Beza.</hi> hath written to the Arch. bi≈øh. of C. that now is.</note> Oppo≈øites, envied of our enemies, di≈øta≈øtfull unto none, but ≈øuch as know neither how to rule, nor how to obey.</p>
                  <p>The very names of puni≈øhments are unplea≈øant indeed; but the things them≈øelves are nece≈ø≈øary ≈øometimes, and their effects good and profitable for pre≈øervation of the whol; how≈øoever the induring of them, may be grievous in the particular. And he that will indifferently con≈øider the true cau≈øes of the corrections here mentioned; ≈øhall have ju≈øt cau≈øe to approve the Ju≈øtice,<note n="*" place="margin">Con≈øpiracy for pretended Reformation.</note> and commend the mildnes, that hath bin u≈øed towards this ≈øort of men.</p>
                  <p>As for that clau≈øe of <hi>Mens traditions,</hi> it is too too odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and would imply Super≈øtition or Popery to be in ≈øome of them; But how vainly, and how injuriou≈øly, hath in ≈øome ≈øort been heretofore declared.</p>
                  <p>That other of <hi>beeing prejudiciall to none but tho≈øe that ≈øeek their own, &amp;c.</hi> is as injurious to all the re≈øt of the Min ≈øters of this land. Be we the men that are ≈øo addicted to <hi>our own quiet, credite, and commoditie in the world?</hi> Where then be the the fruits of our covetou≈ønes, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our ambition, the marks of our idlenes? We be the men, that in the te≈øtimony of a good con≈øcience, for the repelling of ≈øuch a malicious contumely, and ≈ølanderous reproach, may truly ≈øay: We put not out our mony to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury; we dete≈øt all filthy lucre; we contain our ≈øelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:157032:16"/>our Vocations; we for≈øake not our holy callings, we omit not to labour in our ≈øeverall charges; we ≈øu≈øtaine the places of great labour, travaile, and expen≈øe; we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not in publike, in private, in word, in writing, at home and abroad, to put to ≈øilence, and ≈øtop the mouth of the common Adver≈øary, which the≈øe men have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged again≈øt us, and our mo≈øt holy faith.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, the thing they ≈øeeke is ≈øo <hi>prejudiciall,</hi> both to the Civill ≈øtate in generall, and in particular, to ≈øo many of the very be≈øt of the Mini≈øtery; that if it ≈øhould take effect, but God of his mercy, and the Kings mo≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maje≈øty in his Chri≈øtian wi≈ødome, will not ≈øuffer it) it would breed a ≈øtrange alteration in the One; and in the Other it would for the pre≈øent, not only impoveri≈øh us, and our Univer≈øities, but make both them and us, and the whol Clergy very ba≈øe and contemptible in the eies of our own people, as al≈øo a by-word and ≈øcorne to our neighbour Nations; And for ≈øucceeding ages, it would cut off all hope of a learned Mini≈øtery, and of that grounded learning, which as yet is, and heretofore hath been, the glory and honour of this kingdome.</p>
                  <p>For manife≈øtation of this point, look upon the face of all the reformed Churches in the world; and where≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the de≈øire of the≈øe Petitioners doth take place, be it duly con≈øidered; fir≈øt, how well their proceedings do ≈øuit with the ≈øtate of a <hi>Monarchy;</hi> And then, how poverty on the one ≈øide, and lack of learning on the other, doth creep upon the whole Clergy in tho≈øe Dominions.</p>
                  <p>As to the fir≈øt: would it not be≈øeem the ≈øupereminent authority and Regal per≈øon of a <hi>King,</hi> to be him≈øelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the limits of ≈øome particular pari≈øh; &amp; then to ≈øubject his ≈øoveraigne power, to the pure Apo≈øtolicall ≈øimplicity, of an over-≈øwaying and all-commanding
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:157032:16"/>Pre≈øbytery? Would it not do him much good, in a time of need, that his people ≈øhould be rooted and grounded in this truth; viz. That his meeke and humble Clergy, have power <hi>to bind their King in chaines, and their Prince in lincks of iron?</hi> that is (in their learning) to cen≈øure him, to enjoyn him penance, to excommunicate him? yea (in ca≈øe they ≈øee cau≈øe) to proceed again≈øt him as a tyrant?</p>
                  <p>We ≈øpeake not here of other points, as namely, that all appeales in cau≈øes Eccle≈øia≈øticall (and what doe they not make Eccle≈øia≈øticall?) mu≈øt finally lie, not unto the Prince, but unto the A≈ø≈øembly Provinciall; That they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ≈øupreme Magi≈øtrate, not <hi>pote≈øtatem juris,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>facti;</hi> while they make him the maintainer of their proceedings, but no commander in them.

                  <q>Nec bona tam ≈øequitur, quam bona prima fuit.</q>
                  <p>In≈øomuch, that there is neither ≈øufficient maintenance in tho≈øe parts, for any ≈øtore of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t learned men, nor yet many men brought up among them in this la≈øt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming age, worthy of that wonted honorable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>God knows we ≈øpeak not this with a detracting Spirit but with grief of heart: to ≈øee the ruines of the Mini≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in particular, and generaly of all profound learning in other reformed Churches. As likewi≈øe to ≈øtirre up this whol nation to a thankfull acknowledgment of that ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ble≈ø≈øing in this behalfe, which God of his goodnes hath long, and yet doth continue unto us of this Realm. And withall, to put to ≈øilence the malicious ingratitude of tho≈øe evill men, which looking upon us &amp; this Church through the colourd gla≈ø≈øe of their prejudicate opinions; can ≈øee nothing among us <hi>but defects and deformities, and abu≈øes and enormities,</hi> and the like. And therfore in their high di≈øcretion, would have us reduced and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the calamities of other places.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, in truth, if we ≈øhall bring back the eyes of our minds from forrein parts, and indifferently (without either detraction or flattery) take notice of the pre≈øent ≈øtate of this Church and Comon-wealth; we ≈øhall ea≈øily di≈øcern, that it were an incomparable happines for them, if all that profe≈ø≈øe the truth as it is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, were in our condition.</p>
                  <p>We ≈øhall ≈øee, how that our Church government is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øubordinate unto the ≈øupreme civill ≈øtate, and withall doth mightily ≈øupport the ≈øame. That our reverend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
